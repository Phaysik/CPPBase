# project-name

## Program Requirements

Run the makefileDependencies file to determine installation steps

```bash
    bash makefileDependencies.sh
```

## Important Note Regarding the Makefile

Do not change any of the variables in the Makefile as it may cause the executable to segfault.

### Breakdown of each Makefile command

| Command                    | Action           |
| -------                    | -----------      |
| compile                    | Runs the create_folders command. Creates a release executable in the output folder. Copies resource folder to the output folder. |
| release                    | Runs the compile command. Runs the release executable in the output folder. |
| debug                      | Runs the create_folders command. Creates a dev executable in the output folder with debugging information in the compiled code. Copies resource folder to the output folder. |
| dev                        | Runs the debug command. Runs the dev executable in the output folder. |
| valgrind                   | Runs the debug command. Runs a memory checker on the executable in the output folder to see if there is any memory leaks. |
| copy_and_run_test          | Copies the resource folder to the output folder. Copies and runs the test executable from the test folder to the output folder. |
| build_test                 | Runs the create_folders commands. Compiles a test executable with Google Test flags. Runs the copy_and_test command. |
| lcov                       | Runs the build_test command. Creates lcov files on the entire codebase. Then removes the lcov files associated with the lcov folder. |
| genhtml                    | Runs the lcov command. Deletes and recreates the genhtml output folder. Creates a set of web pages to view the code coverage of the codebase in the genhtml output folder. |
| coverage                   | Runs the genhtml command. Deletes the test output and lcov output folders. |
| tidy                       | Runs clang tidy on the code base. |
| check                      | Runs cppcheck on the code base. |
| flawfinder                 | Runs flawfinder on the code base. |
| analysis                   | Runs flawfinder, check, and clang-tidy on the code base. |
| format                     | Runs clang format on the code base. |
| run_doxygen                | Runs Doxygen on the Doxyfile. |
| docs                       | Runs the run_doxygen command. Uses sphinx to build the docs from the Doxygen XML output. |
| tracy                      | Runs the create_folders command. Creates an executable with the appropriate flags for the Tracy Profile server. This is only the client, you need to already be running the Tracy Profiler Server and have it be listening for a connection before running this command. |
| gprof                      | Runs the dev command. Creates a profiling folder that contains the annotations and flat map of gprof.                    |
| profile                    | Runs the gprof command. Moves the created annotations files from gprof into the profiling annotations folder.                    |
| create_folders             | Creates the boilerplate folders for running other commands. Does not need to be executed individually. |
| initialize_repo            | Clones a base C++ repository structure into the current directory. Does not need to be executed individually. |

#### Running the code

- For running the release version of the code

```bash
    make release
```

- For running the dev version of the code

```bash
    make dev
```

- For running the test suite

```bash
    make coverage
```

- For checking memory leaks

```bash
    make valgrind
```

- For creating the documentation

```bash
    make docs
```

- For checking linting

```bash
    make (tidy|check|flawfinder|analysis)
```

- For performance profiling

```bash
    make tracy # Using Tracy Profiler (Preferred)
    make profile # Using gprof
```
